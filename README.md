Photometric Stereo in Python
------
written by Yasuyuki Matsushita (yasumat@ist.osaka-u.ac.jp)

based on a part of robust photometric stereo works in 2010-2018 conducted at Microsoft Research Asia and Osaka University
together with external collaborators.


What is Photometric Stereo?
-------

Photometric Stereo is an approach to determining surface normal of 
a scene from a set of images recorded from a fixed viewpoint but under
varying lighting conditions, originally proposed by Woodham [1].
